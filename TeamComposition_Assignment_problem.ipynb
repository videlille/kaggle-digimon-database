    "Problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Team composition is a complex problem which include variables as the gameplay, champion statistics, teammates interactions. Neural network algorithms can be found in the litterature for the best team composition , by example, in Leagues of Legends, where abundants informations are collected as teammates gameplay and datas on victory/losses. However, those algorithms are complex to write, analyze and require a lot of information collection. It seems that the best team is a well-balanced one, amongst other variables. This will be the starting point of the reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Source:\n",
    "Conference paper: Towards automated team composition in MOBA games based on players’ personality: an intelligent approach,Lincoln Costa\n",
    "Ong, Hao Yi & Deolalikar, Sunil & Peng, Mark. (2015). Player Behavior and Optimal Team Composition for Online Multiplayer Games. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find the best team composition by selecting 3 digimons based on the DigiDB_digimonlist dataset. \n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, we consider here that the best team is a balanced team composed of \n",
    "- A Digimon with high physical damage stats\n",
    "- A Digimon with high magical damage stats\n",
    "- A Digimon with high defense stats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That hypothesis is too simple for complex gameplay but it is a good start on champion selection depending on statistics.  This can be treated as an <b>optimization problem</b> known as <b>assignment</b> problem: to assign N Digimons to M different tasks. Here, we have 249 Digimons for 3 different tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the <b>first part</b> of that project, we a simple model that  will assign the best candidates according to our criteria. The suggested solution is verified and compared to a simple analysis. From the previous questions, we know that the best team according to that simple metric is: Chaosmon (318 Atk) GroundLocomon (213 Def) and Lucemon SM or Barbamon (233 int). The model results are validated by the manual analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>second part</b> of the project is to perform a deeper analysis by adding more complex metrics and Digimons filtering. First, we exclude all digimons who have a statistic below the average of all Digimons. This selection let us with 19 Digimons. Second, new metrics are designed to take in consideration more variables combinations. The best team is now composed of:\n",
    "- A Digimon with high physical damage and high speed stats ( Atk * Spd  = TotDam)\n",
    "- A Digimon with best ratio magical damage to SP ( Int / SP  = MtoSP )\n",
    "- A Digimon with high defense stats ( HP + Def = Tank)\n",
    "With those hypothesis, the best team is: (TotDam) Leopardmon LM (TotDam), Alphamon (MtoSP), Imperialdramon FM (Tank)\n",
    "\n",
    "In <b>conclusion</b>, we succeed to compose a team respecting our hypothesis. The model can be modified easily to taken in account more features, more champions or a team with different size or characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is still quite simple and don't consider a lot of variables in the gameplay. These specificities are hard to capture and to understand completely and will require much more work, datas and a more complex model. However, there is room for small improvements and result analysis by exploiting the datas already present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some suggested improvements are:\n",
    "- Updated filtering methods, the cost notion becomes more important with few Digimons to select from which can be achieved with higher filtering. \n",
    "- New metrics for candidate selections, Memory and Equip slots could be included as a malus in the cost.\n",
    "- Include the attribute and type selection in the algorithm, to ensure a team balance \n",
    "- Add supportlist and movelist to the analysis by assigning to each of those moves a score that could be added to the appropriate category of pokemon. As example, a special power incresing the damage could be added as a +5 in the 'TotDam' stat\n",
